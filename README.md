# COVID-19_Power-BI

Created real-time dynamic dashboards in Power BI by importing data from "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries" and staging it into google sheets and publishing it. Once this was done I imported this staged data into Power BI and performed data modeling tasks on it after which dashboards were created.
